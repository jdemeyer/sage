Block designs.

A module to help with constructions and computations of block
designs and other incidence structures.

A block design is an incidence structure consisting of a set of points `P` and a
set of blocks `B`, where each block is considered as a subset of `P`. More
precisely, a *block design* `B` is a class of `k`-element subsets of `P` such
that the number `r` of blocks that contain any point `x` in `P` is independent
of `x`, and the number `\lambda` of blocks that contain any given `t`-element
subset `T` is independent of the choice of `T` (see [1]_ for more). Such a block
design is also called a `t-(v,k,\lambda)`-design, and `v` (the number of
points), `b` (the number of blocks), `k`, `r`, and `\lambda` are the parameters
of the design. (In Python, ``lambda`` is reserved, so we sometimes use ``lmbda``
or ``L`` instead.)

In Sage, sets are replaced by (ordered) lists and the standard representation of
a block design uses `P = [0,1,..., v-1]`, so a block design is specified by
`(v,B)`.

    each of which contains `\\frac {|F|^{d+1}-1} {|F|-1}` lines.

    - ``n`` is the projective dimension

    - ``d`` is the dimension of the subspaces of `P = PPn(F)` which

    Returns a projective plane of order `n`.

    A finite projective plane is a 2-design with `n^2+n+1` lines (or blocks) and
    `n^2+n+1` points. For more information on finite projective planes, see the
    :wikipedia:`Projective_plane#Finite_projective_planes`.

    - ``type`` -- When set to ``"Desarguesian"``, the method returns
      Desarguesian projective planes, i.e. a finite projective plane obtained by
      considering the 1- and 2- dimensional spaces of `F_n^3`.

      For the moment, no other value is available for this parameter.

    Returns an Affine Geometry Design.

      (i.e. an integer)
