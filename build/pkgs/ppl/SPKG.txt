= Parma Polyhedra Library =

== Description ==
The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions
especially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and
verification of complex systems. These abstractions include convex
polyhedra, defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open or
closed) halfspaces, each described by a linear inequality (strict or
non-strict) with rational coefficients; some special classes of
polyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision
tradeoffs; and grids which represent regularly spaced points that
satisfy a set of linear congruence relations. The library also
supports finite powersets and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and
grids, a mixed integer linear programming problem solver using an
exact-arithmetic version of the simplex algorithm, a parametric
integer programming solver, and primitives for the termination
analysis via the automatic synthesis of linear ranking functions.

It is written in C++, but comes with interfaces to C, Java, OCaml, and
Prolog. PPL is one of the fastest implementations of polyhedral
computations.
