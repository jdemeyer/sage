== Description ==

PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast
computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number
theory, elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other
useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as
matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot
of transcendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to
allow for faster computations.

Originally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Universit√©
Bordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim
Belabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.

See patches/README.txt for a list of patches.

Most of the building of a new version of the PARI spkg is automated
in the script spkg-src.  Normally, the following should work.  In case
of doubt, have a look at the file spkg-src.

  0) Edit the line "git checkout pari-2.5.5".

  1) ./spkg-src
     This will download the git sources to the directory parigit/
     and will also download galdata.tgz and ellsea-small.tgz.
     Then, a src/ directory will be created.
     WARNING: This script will remove any existing src/ directory.
     NOTES: The script ./spkg-src will actually compile PARI/GP, but
     the compiled files are not used for the spkg.  We only need a few
     files, in particular those created by bison.
     Running spkg-src should be done on a reasonably standard machine
     on which PARI/GP compiles out of the box.

  2) Check that everything is okay somehow.  In particular, look at
     patches/README.txt

  3) rm -rf parigit
     The directory parigit contains a git repository for the PARI sources.
     When making this package just for testing, you can keep the parigit
     directory.  However, it should not be there in a final version.

  4) cd ..; sage --spkg pari-version-name
